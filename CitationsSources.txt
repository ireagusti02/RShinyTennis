  This is the RShiny App (Swim Teams) which served as a basis for our app, 
  Tennis Court Finder. We reduced our scope to one tab, Program Finder in 
  the Swim Teams app, and repurposed/redesigned the functions and layout
  to fit our needs.

File: tennis_courts.csv 
  We originally used a .csv file from Kaggle, but found that this source 
  had the same information as the Kaggle file as well as a column for court 
  name, so we decided to change to this file.

File: table-data.csv 
  We selected this file in order to join map_data("state) with courts.
  map_data("state") had lowercase, fully spelled out state names, 
  which we replace with the uppercase abbreviations from table-data.csv.
