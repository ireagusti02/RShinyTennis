## Tennis Court Finder

This is an R-shiny app which displays various aspects of tennis courts around the United States. This app allows the user to intuitively find tennis clubs in their desired state. Users can filter by number of courts, surface, existence of a tennis "Pro-Shop" and if data allows it, city, through a search bar.
