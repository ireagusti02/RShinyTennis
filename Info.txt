Motivation: 

-> We both play on the Grinnell College varsity tennis team! 

-> Finding where to play in Iowa is not an easy task, our data set showed no 
   court data in our state. Objectively we know there are some places mostly in 
   Des Moines 
   
-> Easily accessing court info in the desired area.


Explanation of Data Sources: 

-> tennis_courts.csv 

    -> Source from Kaggle and Data World 
  
    -> Over 29,000 courts
  
    -> Organized by location (with coordinates) 
  
    -> Includes features and descriptions such as access, number of cours, type 
       of surface, etc. 
     
    -> Acknowledgement: This is an old data set; not all tennis courts in the US 
       are listed, and coordinates may be imprecise. We have removed states with 
       very poorly recorded coordinates. 

-> table-data.csv

    -> This was used to merge tennis_courts.csv with map_data("state") polys
  

Description of Features: 

-> Feature 1: Four filters in the sidebar 

    -> Select Access: Check box inputs with a choice of public and/or courts 
                      (must select at least one)
                        
    -> Select Surface(s): Check box inputs with a choice of Hard, Clay, and/or 
                          Grass (must select at least one) 
                        
    -> Select State: Drop down input to select a single state
  
    -> Court Count: Slider to select a number of courts (1-50) 
  
-> Feature 2: plotly

    -> If a user does not select at least one type of access and surface, then 
       there will be no graph or table displayed as there is no data available 
     
    -> If a user selects at least one type of access and surface but there are 
       no existing courts in the state which match the filter options, then 
       a message will be displayed and the state will be grayed out 
     
    -> The graph will constantly refresh with a spinner when new inputs are 
       given 
       
    -> There are two keys for the legend: access and surface. Access is 
       characterized by circle or triangle. Surface is characterized by blue for 
       Hard, orange for Clay, and green for Grass 
       
    -> There is hover text for the plotly which displays the name, access, and 
       surface 

    -> Since the graph is a plotly, users are able to zoom in 
       
-> Feature 3: Data table 

    -> The data table includes the four filtered variables along with the rest 
       of the other hidden variables from the data set. 
       
    -> The data table serves as a way to track categorical and numerical info 
       corresponding to each specific court. 
       
    -> Users can change low/high sort for columns or use the search bar to 
       further narrow down their search. 
       
-> Feature 4: Street Map 

    -> The street map uses a leaflet to add a street map 
    
    -> It uses the same reactive filters used by the plotly, so it will show 
       the courts for the selected state and filter only 


Relevant Findings 

    -> While the data set may be incomplete, the graph allows us to visualize 
       density, hoverable info and distribution within each state 

    -> Using the plotly as well as the leaflet, users are able to see that the 
       major clusters in each state are centered around the major cities
